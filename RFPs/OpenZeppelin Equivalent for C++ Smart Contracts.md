"OpenZeppelin Equivalent for C++ Smart Contracts

Overview

This project aims to develop a C++ smart contract library for the Qubic platform, inspired by OpenZeppelin’s Solidity contracts. The library will offer reusable components and secure code patterns to standardize and enhance smart contract development on Qubic.

Objectives
        •        Create a modular C++ library for Qubic smart contracts.
        •        Implement tested modules for functionalities like token standards, access control, and upgradeability.
        •        Incorporate best practices to improve security.
        •        Promote standardization in Qubic smart contract development.

High-Level Design

The library will include:
        •        Token Standards: Implementations for fungible and non-fungible tokens.
        •        Access Control: Role-based access control modules.
        •        Upgradeability: Tools for safe contract upgrades.
        •        Security Utilities: Components to prevent common vulnerabilities.

Components
        •        Token Modules: Classes for creating and managing tokens.
        •        Access Control Modules: Mechanisms for defining roles and permissions.
        •        Upgradeability Modules: Tools supporting contract upgrades.
        •        Security Modules: Utilities for safe operations and reentrancy protection.

Workflow
        1.        Integration: Developers include the library in their Qubic projects.
        2.        Implementation: Utilize modules to build contracts with standardized components.
        3.        Deployment: Deploy contracts on the Qubic network, leveraging the library’s security and reliability.

Security Measures
        •        Code Audits: Regular audits to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
        •        Community Review: Encourage community involvement in reviewing and testing.
        •        Best Practices: Adhere to industry standards for secure development.

Proposals and Improvements

Contributions to enhance the library are welcome. Proposals should include technical and functional designs, focusing on ease of integration and security standards."
