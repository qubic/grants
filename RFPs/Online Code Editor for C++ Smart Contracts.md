# Online Code Editor for C++ Smart Contracts

## Overview

This project aims to develop a web-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) tailored for creating, simulating, and testing C++ smart contracts on the Qubic platform. The IDE will feature syntax highlighting, debugging tools, and live contract simulation to facilitate rapid prototyping and testing, thereby lowering the barrier to entry and accelerating the development process.

## Objectives

- Provide a user-friendly, web-based IDE for C++ smart contract development on Qubic.
- Incorporate features such as syntax highlighting, debugging tools, and live contract simulation.
- Enable developers to prototype and test smart contracts efficiently.
- Enhance accessibility and streamline the development workflow.

## High-Level Design

The IDE will be accessible through modern web browsers, offering a seamless development experience without the need for local installations. Key components include:

- **Code Editor**: Supports C++ syntax highlighting and code completion.
- **Debugger**: Provides step-by-step execution, breakpoints, and variable inspection.
- **Simulator**: Allows live testing of smart contracts within the IDE.
- **Version Control Integration**: Supports integration with Git repositories for version management.

## Components

- **Frontend**: Developed using modern web technologies to ensure responsiveness and ease of use.
- **Backend**: Handles code compilation, execution, and interaction with the Qubic network.
- **Security**: Implements secure authentication and data protection measures.

## Workflow

1. **Development**: Users write C++ smart contract code in the editor with real-time syntax highlighting and code suggestions.
2. **Debugging**: Utilize debugging tools to identify and resolve issues within the code.
3. **Simulation**: Test contracts in a simulated environment to ensure correct functionality.
4. **Deployment**: Once validated, deploy contracts to the Qubic network directly from the IDE.

## Security Measures

- **Sandboxing**: Isolate contract execution to prevent unauthorized access and ensure system integrity.

## Proposals and Improvements

Contributions to enhance the IDEâ€™s functionality are welcome. Proposals should include technical and functional designs, focusing on ease of integration, user experience, and adherence to security standards.
