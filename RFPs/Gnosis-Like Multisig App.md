"Gnosis-Like Multisig Application for Qubic

Overview

This project aims to develop a multisignature (multisig) wallet application for the Qubic platform, inspired by Gnosis Safe. The application will enable secure, multi-party management of digital assets, requiring multiple approvals for transactions to enhance security and prevent unauthorized access.

Objectives
        •        Develop a user-friendly multisig wallet for Qubic.
        •        Implement robust security measures to protect digital assets.
        •        Facilitate collaborative management of funds among multiple parties.
        •        Ensure compatibility with existing Qubic network protocols.

High-Level Design

The application will consist of the following components:
        •        User Interface (UI): A web-based interface for creating and managing multisig wallets, initiating transactions, and monitoring activity.
        •        Smart Contracts: Contracts deployed on the Qubic network to handle wallet creation, transaction approvals, and fund management.
        •        Backend Services: Servers to process requests, interact with the blockchain, and manage user authentication.

Components
        •        Wallet Creation Module: Allows users to set up multisig wallets, define signers, and specify the number of required approvals.
        •        Transaction Module: Enables initiation, approval, and execution of transactions, ensuring they meet the required approval threshold.
        •        Notification System: Alerts signers of pending transactions and status updates.
        •        Security Features: Includes authentication mechanisms, encryption, and activity logs to ensure asset protection.

Workflow
        1.        Wallet Setup: Users create a multisig wallet, define signers, and set the required number of approvals.
        2.        Transaction Initiation: A signer proposes a transaction through the application.
        3.        Approval Process: Other signers receive notifications and approve or reject the transaction.
        4.        Execution: Once the required approvals are obtained, the transaction is executed on the Qubic network.

Security Measures
        •        Authentication: Implement secure login and access controls for users.
        •        Encryption: Protect sensitive data in transit and at rest using strong encryption protocols.
        •        Audit Logs: Maintain detailed logs of all actions for transparency and accountability.
        •        Regular Audits: Conduct periodic security assessments to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.

Proposals and Improvements

Contributions to enhance the application’s functionality are welcome. Proposals should include technical and functional designs, focusing on ease of integration, user experience, and adherence to security standards. Mobile app"
