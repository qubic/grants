## Introduction

The Qubic Grants Program aims to foster the development of high-quality smart contracts and solutions that enhance the Qubic ecosystem. We encourage proposals that address various needs within the ecosystem, such as:

- Liquidity Pools
- Name Service
- Derivatives Contracts
- Token Insurance
- Lending Protocols
- Developer tools
- SC Builder for dummy’s
- Token creation
- Crowdfunding platform
- Freelance work contracts / Automate pay-roll: Leveraging the feeless Qubic transfers for streaming payments
- Carbon Credits Trading
- Loyalty programs
- Bounty program
- DeFi Yield Farming
- Data Marketplaces
- UI/UX QX
- UI/UX Quottery
- Tradehistory TXs
- Mixing Service
- Decentralized voting
- UX to interact with SC
- Other Projects: Any other smart contracts that can serve as fundamental infrastructure for future developments.

## Program Objectives

- **High-Quality Smart Contracts**: Ensure that developed contracts meet the highest standards of quality and security. This includes rigorous testing and code reviews to guarantee reliability.
- **Reusability**: Support the creation of smart contracts that can be used by other projects within the Qubic ecosystem. This encourages standardization and efficiency in development.
- **Ecosystem Growth**: Facilitate the creation of tools and services that drive the adoption of the Qubic platform. By providing necessary infrastructure, we aim to attract more developers and projects to Qubic.

## Application Process

The grant application process will be conducted in batches, with specific grant windows open for a designated period. This approach allows for thorough review and selection of proposals while fostering a strong community of applicants. By organizing the grants in batches, we can provide better support and engagement for each cohort, enhancing collaboration and ensuring a high standard of development within the Qubic ecosystem. Please refer to the Qubic website for the current grant window timelines and submit your proposal within the designated time frame.

1. **Initial Proposal**: Submit a detailed proposal through the Qubic website using our application form. The form will ask for details such as your company/project name, website URL/GitHub, personal information (first name, last name, country, email address), a detailed description of the proposal, funding amount requested, a plan and approach with costing and rationale, team member backgrounds and experience, and how your proposal benefits the Qubic ecosystem.
2. **Review and Selection**: Our team will review the proposals and select the most promising ones based on their potential impact, feasibility, and alignment with Qubic’s goals.
3. **Development and Delivery**: Selected developers will receive funding based on the completion of key milestones, ensuring accountability and encouraging thorough testing. The funding will be distributed in four tranches:
    - Milestone 1: Initial setup and basic functionality - 25%
    - Milestone 2: Mid-development review and progress demonstration - 25%
    - Milestone 3: Beta version delivery and testing phase - 25%
    - Milestone 4: Final deployment and full functionality - 25%
4. **Evaluation and Audit**: The smart contracts will be evaluated and audited to ensure they meet the program’s requirements. This includes code reviews, security audits, and performance testing.

## Detailed Proposal Requirements

- **Concept Validation**: The proposal must include a well-researched or tested concept, ideally with evidence of prior work. Demonstrate the feasibility and potential impact of your project.
- **Technical Design**: A detailed technical design is required. The more comprehensive, the better. Include diagrams, flowcharts, and any other relevant documentation.
- **Relevant Experience**: Proven experience with relevant languages (e.g., C++) and front-end implementations. Provide examples of past projects or contributions to similar technologies.
- **Sustainable Development**: Demonstrate that the project will be maintained after the grant is completed, either through a commitment to the technology, additional funding sources, or an existing business model. Outline your plans for long-term support and updates.
- **Innovation**: Highlight how the application stands out among competitors or implements technology that is not yet present in the ecosystem. Show how your project will add unique value.
- **Open Source**: All produced code must be open-source and should not rely on closed-source software for full functionality. Preferred licenses include Apache 2.0, GPLv3, MIT. All projects must comply with the terms of the [Anti Military Licence](https://github.com/computor-tools/qubic-crypto/blob/main/LICENSE).
- **Token Sales**: Projects planning a token sale are not eligible for grants. Focus on community benefit without requiring a specific token. Explain how your project will enhance the ecosystem without financial incentives.
  - **Exceptions**: There will be exceptions, such as token swaps with other communities that benefit the interoperability and use of Qubic’s technology, and some other specific cases.
- **Multiple Grants**: A team can apply for several grants. Outline how you plan to manage multiple projects and ensure quality across all of them.
- **Legal Compliance**: We do not fund projects that encourage criminal activities. Ensure that your proposal adheres to all relevant laws and regulations.

## Project Guidelines

- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation explaining the functionality. This should include user guides, API documentation, and technical specifications.
- **Tutorials**: Video tutorials to explain user interfaces are highly encouraged. These tutorials will help users understand and utilize the smart contracts effectively.
